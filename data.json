But for my generation of #emoji#, software is the #emoji# to our #noun# and our #noun#. And that #verb.s# that we #verb# a #adverb#, #adverb# more #emoji# #noun# of #noun.s# to #verb# those #noun.s#, to not #verb# computers as #emoji# and #adj# and #adj# and #emoji#, to #verb# them as #noun.s# that they can #verb# and #verb# around and #verb#, and so #emoji#. \

And I #verb.ed# what every #adj# #adj# girl would want to #verb#. I wanted to somehow #verb# all of this #noun#, so I #verb.ed# him a #adj# website, it's over here. And in 2001, there was no #emoji#, there was no #emoji#, there was no #emoji#. So I needed to #verb# to code in order to #verb# all of this #emoji# and #emoji#. \
  And that is how programming #verb.ed# for me. It #verb.ed# as a #noun.s# of self-#noun#. Just like when I was #adj#, I would #verb# #emoji# and #emoji#. And when I was #emoji#, I would #verb# #noun# #noun.s# and #noun# #noun.s#. But #adverb#, there were #adj# #emoji# to get #adj# about, like #noun# and knitting #noun.s# and conjugating French #adj# #noun.s# and coming up with #emoji#-#emoji# #noun.s# and #people# and his #profession#. And I #verb.ed# to #verb# one of those #emoji# who felt that computers are #adj# and #adj# and #adj#. \
  Here's what I #verb# today. #adj.capitalize# girls don't #verb# that they are not supposed to #verb# computers. #adj.capitalize# girls are #emoji#. They are #adverb#, #adverb# #adj# at #verb# on #noun.s# and being #adj# and they #verb# amazing #noun.s# like, '#adverb.capitalize#?' and '#adverb.capitalize#?' and '#adverb.capitalize#?' and '#adverb.capitalize# if?' And they don't #verb# that they are not supposed to #verb# computers. It's the #title.s# who do. It's us #title.s# who #verb# like computer #emoji# is this #adj#, #adj# science #emoji# that only #verb.s# to the #emoji# makers.
